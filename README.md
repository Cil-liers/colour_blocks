# colour_blocks
This is a small python program in which the user can create different coloured blocks that fall and build small towers.

## About the program
This was an interesting project which I enjoyed thoroughly. In this project I made use of Pygame which is an open-source python based library for making games.
The idea behind this project was to see if I could simulate the gravitational fall of objects in a 2D space.

## Challenges
I found it difficult making the blocks fall if a block underneath it had disappeared as initially the blocks would fall and once landed would not fall again.

### Note
This is not necessarily the end of the project, it is a work in progress that I intend to change and evolve!
